WIP

Airstack aims to make developers and devops more productive. One of the biggest productivity
impediments with servers is dealing with inconsistent tool versions and limitations of
shell scripting languages.

Airstack will provide a universally available scripting language for configuring and
managing services. This is experimental and WIP.

See [Scripting Languages](https://github.com/airstack/docs/blob/master/scripting_languages.md) doc.
