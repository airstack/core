# Product Comparison Matrix

Docker is a lower level Linux container API and therefore cannot be overly opinionated.
Docker makes using Linux kernel cgroups much easier, but it's too low level to make devops
painless for developers. Airstack makes Docker painless.

CoreOS relies on systemd. Airstack relies on runit. Airstack is more focused as an
opionated microservice framework.
